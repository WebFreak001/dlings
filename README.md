# Dlings
Welcome to `dlings`. This project aims to teach you how to program in D.
If the name doesn't sound strange, it's because you might have heard of `rustlings` or `ziglings`. In fact, this is **heavily** based on [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings). If you're familiar with how `rustlings` work, you will have no trouble getting started with `dlings`.

# Getting started
Clone the project, *cd* into it, and run `dub --build=release`.
Now you should have a `dlings` executable.
Run `dlings --help` to see all commands available. You can also type `dlings <command> --help` for more information about a command.

# Status
This project is in its early days. Currently, only exercises used for testing are
available.

# Contributing
Any suggestion, enhancement, or fix, is appreciated.
